####Approach
I began this project by working through the trello board and doing my best to document everything that needed to be created.  To begin coding I started with the back end working on each route and testing them with Postman to ensure they were working propely.  I then started working through the front end routes and creating a partial for each view, also testing along the way.  I then began implementing features and will continue to add the necessary features to make this app useable.
